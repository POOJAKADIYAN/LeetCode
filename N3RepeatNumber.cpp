Youâ€™re given a read only array of n integers. Find out if any integer occurs more than n/3 times in the array in linear time 
and constant additional space.

If so, return the integer. If not, return -1.

If there are multiple solutions, return any one.

Example :

Input : [1 2 3 1 1]
Output : 1 
1 occurs 3 times which is more than 5/3 times.

# Solution Approach (Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm)
 
The essential concepts is you keep a counter for the majority number X. If you find a number Y that is not X, 
the current counter should deduce by 1. The reason is that if there is 5 X and 4 Y, there would be one (5-4) more X than Y. 
This could be explained as "4 X being paired out by 4 Y".

And since the requirement is finding the majority for more than ceiling of [n/3], 
the answer would be less than or equal to two numbers.
So we can modify the algorithm to maintain two counters for two majorities.

    // Do not write main() function.
    // Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function.
    // Do not print the output, instead return values as specified

    int n = A.size();
